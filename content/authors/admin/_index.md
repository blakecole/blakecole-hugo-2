    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About
Blake Cole is a general-purpose engineer with deep expertise in marine robotics, aerodynamics, and data science.  He earned his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2024.  As a doctoral student, Blake developed a physics-based optimization methodology for rigid wingsails, and later validated his approach using a bespoke data acquisition system.  He also made meaningful contributions to the fields of vehicle autonomy and state estimation.  Blake remains interested in designing, building, and testing intelligent flying machines.
